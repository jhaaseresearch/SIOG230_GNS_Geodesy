These are the instructions for HW2

The homework assignment 2 is to write a function xyz2wgs.m to convert from xyz to wgs84 following the equations in the geodesy_lab book section 1.1.2 p. 3.
please write the function so that the input is a N x 4 array of time(sec), x(m), y(m), z(m) and the output is an array of time, long(deg), lat(deg), height(m).
Set the time = 1 in your input data.


To check your code, verify that:
Lat = 45.8791, Lon = 4.6766, Ele = 432.4222 m
corresponds to:
X = 4433469.9438 m, Y = 362672.7267 m, Z = 4556211.6409 m
